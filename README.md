# esp32-light-sensor


## Version 1:
V1 of the light-sensor design. V1 includes the same hardware as V2, the difference is that in V1 the esp32's act alone therefore they do not communicate with eachother. 
#### Folder Structure for V1:
**single-esp32**
- 3D-Model

    Contains a rhino6 model of the V1 Chassis to scale. Can be extracted to 3D print.
- Diagrams 

    Contains wiring diagram as well as exploded model diagram to help with putting it together





## Version 2:
*in progress*

Multiple esp32's communicating together to turn on led with a distance sensor. 
#### Folder Structure for V2:
**multiple-esp32**
- 3D-Model

    Contains a rhino6 model of the V2 Chassis to scale. Can be extracted to 3D print.
- Diagrams 

    Contains wiring diagram as well as exploded model diagram to help with putting it together
